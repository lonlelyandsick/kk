		<h2><a title="인터넷과 웹" href="#">인터넷과 웹</a></h2>
		
		<p>The words "Internet" and "Web" are sometimes used in the same sense, and if there's a subtle difference, the Internet is not different from the Web in that something is intertwined across borders, but the Internet is a computer-to-computer network, and the Web is an intangible information network. On the Internet, not only the web but also other services such as e-mail are used, and the web is one of those services. However, since the "web" accounts for such a high proportion of the Internet's utilization, the two words are used in almost the same meaning.</p>
		<blockquote><p>The web provides multimedia information such as text, pictures, sounds, and videos on the Internet by hypertexting.Hypertext is a technology that allows multiple documents on the web to be referenced by inserting references that lead to another document inside a document.A reference from within a document to another document is called a hyperlink.</p></blockquote>
		<p>Computers connected to the web are called clients and servers.
			A client is a web browser (typically a Firefox or Chrome web browser) that is available on devices with a typical web user's Internet connection (e.g., your computer is connected to a WI-FI, or your phone is connected to a mobile network).
			A server is a computer that stores web pages, sites, or apps. When the client's device wants to access the web page, a copy of the web page is downloaded from the server to the client's device for display in your web browser.</p>
